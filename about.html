		<h1>About US</h1>
		<p> The idea for PLATO was a result of a personal journey. This past summer (2015), I was chosen to participate in the Governor General's Canadian Leadership Conference which focused on the role that leaders across Canada can play in inspiring and implementing innovation in their organizations and communities. During the conference, the Truth and Reconciliation Report was released. That Aboriginal people in Canada are a fast growing population that are simultaneously experiencing under employment and lower entrepreneurial opportunities than they could have was highlighted in some of our subsequent discussions about the report.</p>
